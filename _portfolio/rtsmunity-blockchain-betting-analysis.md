RTS Munity is an e-sports betting and trading provider.
They asked me to analyze new blockchain betting technology.

I studied and described existing kinds of blockchain bets:

- Pool bets 
- Peer-to-peer bets 
- Multi-peer bets

I performed analysis of about 18 past and present blockchain projects,
specially designed for making bets.
I researched when each project was created, how it developed and where it is going today,
or has already been abandoned.

Though the result of this analysis is proprietary,
I shared some of my thoughts on this topic in this short
[post]({% post_url 2020-11-10-blockchain-fair-bets %}).
