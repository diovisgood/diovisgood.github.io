Here is a short summary of a project I recently completed
during my study of reinforcement learning algorithms.

I believe, if you really want to understand some algorithm, **you should write it yourself**.

That is why I implemented several algorithms from scratch and ensured they work as intended:

- Covariance Matrix Adaptation for Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES).
- Deep Q-Network (DQN), with options: Duelling-DQN, ...
- Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)
- Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), the synchronized version of A3C, yet with multiple worker threads.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO demonstrated the best results.
