RTS Munity is an e-sport odds and trading provider.

I implemented a bundle of small models for predictions of different match outcomes
for bets on e-sports games.
Predictions were made based on some preliminary data available.

## Challenge

The challenge for me was the necessity to use the **R-language**,
which I had no experience earlier.

I learned new language and created a complete R-package with unit-tests and documentation.
