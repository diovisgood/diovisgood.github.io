RTS Munity is an e-sports betting and trading provider.
There are many online tournaments held every day,
and there are a lot of people watching them online and making their bets.
RTS Munity analyzes the gameplay and gives the chances (probabilities)
of winning a particular team in real time. 

I implemented a bundle of small models for predictions of different match outcomes
for bets on e-sports games.
Predictions were made based on some preliminary data available.

## Challenges

The challenge for me was the necessity to use the **R-language**,
which I had no experience earlier.

I learned new language and created a complete R-package with unit-tests and documentation.
